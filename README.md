## User Types

- Rider: You can request a ride while looking at your location (which is updated very frequently) on a map. Once you click the 'Request Ride' button, your request is stored on the online database.
- Driver: You can view available requests from other riders. Once you click on a request, you see the rider's postition relative to yours on a map. Accepting the request brings up a navigation dialog to the rider's position.
